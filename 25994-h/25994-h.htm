<h2>EXPLOSIVE AND POISONED MUSKET AND RIFLE BALLS.</h2>

<p>The following remarkable statement occurs as a note to the
account of the battle of Gettysburg, on page 78, volume III, of
"The Pictorial History of the Civil War in the United States of
America, by Benson J. Lossing, LL. D.":</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Many, mostly young men, were maimed in every conceivable
way, by every kind of weapon and missile, the most fiendish of
which was an explosive and a poisoned bullet, represented in the
engraving a little more than half the size of the originals, procured
from the battlefield there by the writer. <i>These were sent by the Confederates.
Whether any were ever used by the Nationals, the writer is not
informed.</i> One was made to explode in the body of the man, and
the other to leave a deadly poison in him, whether the bullet lodged
in or passed through him.</p>

<p>Figure A represents the explosive bullet. The perpendicular
stem, with a piece of thin copper hollowed, and a head over it of
bullet metal, fitted a cavity in the bullet proper below it, as seen
in the engraving. In the bottom of the cavity was fulminating
powder. When the bullet struck, the momentum would cause the
copper in the outer disc to flatten, and allow the point of the stem
to strike and explode the fulminating powder, when the bullet
would be rent into fragments which would lacerate the victim.</p>

<p>In figure B the bullet proper was hollowed, into which was
inserted another, also hollow, containing poison. The latter being
loose, would slip out and remain in the victim's body or limbs
with its freight of poison if the bullet proper should pass through.
Among the Confederate wounded at the College were boys of tender
age and men who had been forced into the ranks against their will.</p></div>

<p>The italics I am responsible for. It is difficult for those who
live at the South to realize how extensively such insinuating slanders
as the above against the Confederates are credited at the
North, even by reading people.</p>

<p>I purpose in this paper to examine the statement of the author
of this Pictorial History, and to show, by indisputable proof, its
recklessness and its falsity. In the above quotation, he states that
he had picked up, on the battlefield of Gettysburg, an <i>explosive</i> and
a <i>poisoned</i> ball. "<i>These</i>," he adds, "<i>were sent by the Confederates.
Whether any were ever used by the Nationals, the writer is not informed.</i>"
I do not desire to be severe beyond justice; but it does seem that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
as no one ventured to inform him to the contrary, this author
accepted the silence of the world and deliberately put into print
this slander against the Confederates without having made any
apparent effort to learn, as he could have done with ease, whether
his statement had any basis of truth.</p>

<p>It is with entire confidence in the facts presented in this paper
that I <i>deny</i> this author's statement, above, to be a statement of fact.
I do more than this&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>I most emphatically deny that the Confederate States ever authorized
the use of explosive or poisoned musket or rifle balls.</i></p>

<p>II. I most emphatically assert that the United States <i>did purchase,
authorize, issue and use explosive musket or rifle balls</i> during the
late civil war, and that they were thus officially authorized and
used at the battle of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>It happened in 1864, the day after the negro troops made their
desperate and drunken charge on the Confederate lines to the left
of Chaffin's farm and were so signally repulsed, that the writer, who
was located in the trenches a mile still further to the left, picked
up, in the field outside the trenches assailed by the negroes, some
of the cartridges these poor black victims had dropped, containing
the very "<i>explosive</i>" ball described in the above quotation and
charged to the Confederates. I have preserved one of these balls
ever since. It lies before me as I write. It is similar to figure A,
and with a <i>zinc</i> and not a <i>copper</i> disc. <i>It never contained any fulminating
powder.</i> The construction of the ball led me to make investigations
to ascertain its purpose. At first, I thought it might be
made to leave in the body of the person struck by it three pieces
of metal, instead of one, to irritate, and possibly destroy life. But
this theory appeared to me so "fiendish" that I was unwilling to
accept it, and I became convinced, after more careful examination,
that the purpose of the ball was to increase the momentum, by
forcing in the cap and expanding the disc so as to fill up the
grooves of the rifle. The correctness of this view will be proven
in this paper.</p>

<p>In the first place, although the charge made by the author of
the Pictorial History of the Civil War against the Confederates of
having used explosive and poisoned balls, has been made before,
and often repeated since, it has never been supported by one grain
of proof. How did this author ascertain that the balls he picked
up on the battlefield of Gettysburg were sent by the Confederates?
How did he learn that one was an <i>explosive</i> and the other a <i>poisoned</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
projectile? Did he test the explosive power of the one and the
poisonous character of the other? He gives no evidence of having
done so, and advances no proof of his assertions.</p>

<p>It is a very remarkable fact that no case was ever reported in
Northern hospitals, or by Northern surgeons, of Union soldiers
having been wounded by such barbarous missiles as these from the
Confederate side.</p>

<p>I have very carefully examined those valuable quarto volumes
issued by the United States Medical Department and entitled "The
Medical and Surgical History of the Rebellion," and as yet have
failed to find any case of wound or death reported as having
occurred by an explosive or poisoned musket ball, excepting that
on page 91 of volume II of said work there is a table of four thousand
and two (4,002) cases of gunshot wounds of the scalp, <i>two</i> (2)
of which occurred by <i>explosive musket balls</i>. To which army these
two belonged does not appear.</p>

<p>A letter addressed to the Surgeon-General of the United States
by the writer on this subject, has elicited the reply that the Medical
Department is without any information as to wounds by such
missiles. I do not find such projectiles noticed as preserved in the
museum of the Surgeon-General's Department, where rifle projectiles
taken from wounds are usually deposited.</p>

<p>In the <i>second</i> place, the manufacture, purchase, issue or use of
such projectiles for firearms by the Confederate States, is positively
denied by the Confederate authorities, as the following correspondence
will show:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rgt"><span class="smcap">Beauvoir, Miss.</span>, 28th June, 1879.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir&mdash; ... In reply to your inquiries as to the use
of explosive or poisoned balls by the troops of the Confederate
States, I state as positively as one may in such a case that the
charge has no foundation in truth. Our Government certainly did
not manufacture or import such balls, and if any were captured
from the enemy, they could probably only have been used in the
captured arms for which they were suited. I heard occasionally
that the enemy did use explosive balls, and others prepared so as
to leave a copper ring in the wound, but it was always spoken of
as an atrocity beneath knighthood and abhorrent to civilization.
The slander is only one of many instances in which our enemy
have committed or attempted crimes of which our people and their
Government were incapable, and then magnified the guilt by accusing
us of the offences they had committed....</p>

<div class="bk1"><p class="center">Believe me, ever faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="rgt"><span class="smcap">Jefferson Davis.</span></p></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>General Josiah Gorgas, the Chief of Ordnance of the Confederate
States&mdash;now of the University of Alabama&mdash;writes, under date
of July 11th, 1879, that to his "knowledge the Confederate States
never authorized or used explosive or poisoned rifle balls during
the late war." In this statement also General I. M. St. John and
General John Ellicott, both of the Ordnance Bureau, Confederate
States army, entirely concur.</p>

<p>The Adjutant-General of the United States also writes me, under
date of August 22d, 1879, as to the Confederate archives now in
the possession of the National Government, as follows: "In reply
to yours of the 18th August, I have the honor to inform you that
the Confederate States records in the possession of this Department
furnish no evidence that poisoned or explosive musket balls were
used by the army of the Confederate States."</p>

<p>Rev. J. William Jones, D. D., Secretary of the Southern Historical
Society, has written me to the same effect as to the archives in
the possession of the Society.</p>

<p>In the <i>third</i> place, a brief examination of the United States
Patent Office Reports for 1862-3, and the Ordnance Reports for
1863-4, will show that the "<i>explosive and the poisoned balls</i>" which
the author of the "Pictorial History of the Civil War" so gratuitously
charges upon the Confederates, were patented by the United
States Patent Office at Washington, and were purchased, issued and
used by the United States Government, and, what is still more remarkable,
that <i>neither of the aforesaid projectiles were in any sense
explosive or poisoned</i>.</p>

<p>In the Patent Office Report for 1862-3 will be found the following,
with the corresponding illustration in the second volume:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No. 37,145&mdash;Elijah D. Williams, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&mdash;<i>Improvement
in Elongated Bullets</i>&mdash;Patent dated December 9, 1862.</p>

<p>This invention consists in the combination with an elongated expanding
bullet of a leaded pin and a concave expanding disc, the
disc having its concave side against the base of the bullet, and the
pin entering the cavity thereof and operating to produce the flattening
of the disc, by which it is caused <i>to expand against the walls
of and enter the groves of the gun</i>.</p>

<p>Claim&mdash;First, the combination with elongated expanding bullets
of a pin, C, and expanding disc, B, applied substantially as herein
specified. Second, fitting the pin to the cavity of the bullet in the
manner substantially as herein specified, whereby the expansion
of the bullet is caused to commence in the front part of its expanding
portion and to be gradually continued toward the rear as herein
set forth.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>So much for the <i>explosive</i> ball "<i>sent by the Confederates</i>."</p>

<p>In the same volume of the Patent Office Reports will be found
also the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No. 36,197&mdash;Ira W. Shaler, of Brooklyn, New York, and Reuben
Shaler, of Madison, Connecticut, assigned to Ira W. Shaler aforesaid&mdash;<i>Improvement
in Compound Bullet for Small Arms</i>&mdash;Patent dated
August 12, 1862.</p>

<p>This projectile is composed of two or more parts which fit the
bore of the barrel and so constructed that the forward end of each
of the parts in the rear of the front one enters a cavity in the rear
of the one before it, and is formed in relation to the same in such
a manner as to separate from it after leaving the barrel of the gun
and make a slight deviation in its line of flight from that of its
predecessor.</p>

<p>Claim&mdash;The projectile hereinbefore described, made up of two
or more parts, each of equal diameter, constructed as set forth so
as to separate from each other.</p></div>

<p>No illustration of this projectile appears in the illustrated volume
of patents; but an official drawing of it from the Patent
Office lies before me. The ball is slightly different from figure B
(<i>supra</i>), in that it is here perfect, and figure B gives but two parts
of the missile.</p>

<p>So much for the <i>poisoned</i> ball "<i>sent by the Confederates</i>."</p>

<p>Any person ought to know perfectly well that it was not necessary
to invent or construct a rifle ball especially adapted to carry
poison, when the common minnie ball itself, dipped into liquid
poison and coated, as ball cartridges are usually finished, with wax
or tallow, would have effected the same purpose.</p>

<p>To what extent the bullets of Williams and Shaler were used
during the late war by the United States troops, the following official
communication from the War Department at Washington,
under date of September 16, 1879, will show:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir&mdash;In reply to your letter of the 9th instant to the Secretary
of War, I have to inform you that during the late war a great
many of the bullets patented by Elijah D. Williams and about
200,000 of those patented by Ira W. Shaler were used by the
United States.</p>

<div class="bk1"><p class="center">Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="rgt"><span class="smcap">S. C. Lyford</span>, <i>Acting Chief of Ordnance</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the <i>fourth</i> place, in repelling and refuting the charge against
the Confederates of having used explosive musket or rifle projectiles,
I charge the United States Government with not only patenting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
but purchasing and using, especially at the battle of Gettysburg,
an <i>explosive musket shell</i>; nor do I trust to my imagination,
but I present the facts, which are as follows:</p>

<p>In April, 1862, the Commissioner of Public Buildings at Washington
brought to the attention of the Assistant Secretary of War&mdash;then
Mr. John Tucker&mdash;the explosive musket shell invented by
Samuel Gardiner, jr. The Assistant Secretary at once referred the
matter to General James W. Ripley, who was then the Chief of the
Ordnance Bureau at Washington. What action was taken will
appear when it is stated that in May, 1862, the Chief of Ordnance
at the West Point Military Academy made a report to the Government
of a trial of the Gardiner musket shell. In May, 1862, Mr.
Gardiner offered to sell some of his explosive musket shells to the
Government at a stipulated price. His application was referred to
General Ripley with the following endorsement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Will General Ripley consider whether this explosive shell will
be a valuable missile in battle?</p>

<p class="rgt"><span class="smcap">A. Lincoln.</span></p></div>

<p>General Ripley replied that "it had no value as a service projectile."</p>

<p>In June, 1862, Brigadier-General Rufus King, at Fredericksburg,
made a requisition for some of the Gardiner musket shells. On
referring this application to the Chief of Ordnance, General Ripley,
that old army officer, whose sense of right must have been shocked
at this instance of barbarism, a second time recorded his disapproval,
replying that "it was not advisable to furnish any such
missiles to the troops at present in service."</p>

<p>In September, 1862, the Chief of Ordnance of the Eleventh
corps, United States army, recommended the shell to the Assistant
Secretary of War, who ordered 10,000 rounds to be purchased&mdash;made
into cartridges. Of this number, 200 were issued to Mr.
Gardiner for trial by the Eleventh corps. In October, 1862, the
Chief of Ordnance of the Eleventh corps, then in reserve near
Fairfax Courthouse, sent in a requisition, endorsed by the General
commanding the corps, for 20,000 Gardiner musket shells and cartridges.
The Assistant Secretary of War referred the matter to the
Chief of Ordnance, General Ripley, who for the <i>third</i> time recorded
his disapproval of such issue. Nevertheless, the Assistant Secretary
of War ordered the issue to be made to the Eleventh corps of
the remaining 9,800 shells and cartridges, which order was obeyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>In November, 1862, Mr. Gardiner offered to sell to the United
States his explosive musket shell and cartridge at $35 per thousand,
calibre 58. The Assistant Secretary of War at once ordered 100,000,
of which 75,000 were calibre 58 for infantry, and 25,000 calibre
54 for cavalry service.</p>

<p>In June, 1863, the Second New Hampshire volunteers made a
requisition for 35,000 of these shells, and by order of the Assistant
Secretary of War, they received 24,000. Of this number, 10,060
were abandoned in Virginia and 13,940 distributed to the regiment.
The report of this regiment, made subsequently, shows that in the
third quarter of 1863&mdash;that is, from July 1st to October 1st&mdash;about
4,000 of these shells were used in trials and target firing, and about
10,000 were used in action. The Second New Hampshire regiment
was in the battle of Gettysburg, and 49 of its members lie buried
in the cemetery there.</p>

<p>The above statement shows that the Assistant Secretary of War,
against what might be regarded as the protest of the Chief of Ordnance,
purchased 110,000 of the Gardiner explosive musket shells,
and issued to the troops in actual service 35,000, leaving 75,000 on
hand at the close of the war.</p>

<p>In 1866 the Russian Government issued a circular calling a convention
of the Nations for the purpose of declaring against the use
of explosive projectiles in war. To this circular the then Chief of
Ordnance of the United States, General A. B. Dyer, made the following
reply, which I have but little doubt expresses the sentiment
which actuated General Ripley in his disapproval of the purchase
and issue of the Gardiner musket shell:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="bk2"><span class="smcap">Ordnance Office, War Department,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, August 19, 1868.</div>

<p class="clr"><span class="smcap">Hon. J. M. Schofield</span>, <i>Secretary of War</i>:</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;I have read the communication from the Russian Minister
in relation to the abolishment of the use of explosive projectiles
in military warfare, with the attention and care it well deserves.</p>

<p>I concur heartily in the sentiments therein expressed, and I
trust that our Government will respond unhesitatingly to the
proposition in behalf of humanity and civilization. The use in
warfare of explosive balls, so sensitive as to ignite and burst on
striking a substance as soft and yielding as animal flesh (of men
or horses), I consider barbarous and no more to be tolerated by civilized
nations than the universally reprobated practice of using
poisoned missiles, or of poisoning food or drink to be left in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
way of an enemy. Such a practice is inexcusable among any
people above the grade of ignorant savages. Neither do I regard
the use in war of such explosive balls as of any public advantage,
but rather the reverse; for it will have the effect of killing outright,
rather than wounding, and it is known that the care of
wounded men much more embarrasses the future operations of
the enemy than the loss of the same number killed, who require
no further attention which may delay or impede them.</p>

<p>There is a class of explosive projectiles now used, the discontinuance
of which is not demanded by humanity, and the use of
which may be considered legitimate. These are the projectiles
which can only be exploded by contact with hard, resisting substances,
and which are generally used for destroying ships, caissons,
or light fortifications, and not directly against men or animals in
the opposing ranks. These latter ought not and probably cannot
be included in an agreement or treaty to prohibit their use in warfare;
but I strongly advocate an agreement or treaty binding all
civilized nations to discontinue and forever abandon the use in
war of that class of missiles or projectiles which may be used in
small arms and be so sensitive as to explode on contact with animal
flesh.</p>

<p>The papers in the case, received through the State and War
Departments, are herewith returned.</p>

<p>In this connection, I also notice a letter from the Hon. C. M.
Clay, our Minister to Russia, which has been referred to this office
and herewith returned, and on which I have to report. If the
civilized nations persist in refusing to discontinue and abandon the
use of sensitive explosive balls, then it would be well for this Government
to enter into the agreement suggested by Mr. Clay, whereby
we may be enabled to secure their use in case of necessity, by an
agreement with him, or his named authorized agent, for the payment
of a stipulated royalty on each that may be procured from
him, or may be used in the Government service.</p>

<div class="bk1"><p class="center">Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<div class="bk2"><span class="smcap">A. B. Dyer</span>,<br />
<i>Brevet Major-General, Chief of Ordnance</i>.</div></div></div>

<p class="clr">I have recorded enough to show the recklessness and falsity of
the charge against the Confederates of using such missiles in small
arms during the late war, and the public is hereby specifically
"<i>informed whether the Nationals ever used them</i>."</p>

<p>In the Patent Office Report for 1863-4 will be found the following
account of the Gardiner musket shell:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No. 40,468&mdash;Samuel Gardiner, jr., of New York, N. Y.&mdash;<i>Improvement
in Hollow Projectiles</i>&mdash;Patent dated November 3, 1863.</p>

<p>The shell to form the central chamber is attached to a mandrel,
and the metal forced into a mould around it.</p>

<p>Claim&mdash;Constructing shells for firearms by forcing the metal into
a mould around an internal shell supported on a mandrel.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>I have a box of these shells in my possession. They are open
for examination by any persons who may desire to see them.</p>

<p>This summer the distinguished officer who commanded the 143d
regiment of Pennsylvania volunteers, United States army, at the
battle of Gettysburg, informed me that during the last day of the
battle, he and his men frequently heard, above their heads, amid
the whistling of the minnie balls from the Confederate side, sharp,
explosive sounds like the snapping of musket caps. He mentioned
the matter to an ordnance officer at the time. The officer
replied that what he heard was explosive rifle balls, which the Confederates
had captured from the Union troops, who had lately received
them from the Ordnance Department.</p>

<p>From the fact that the Gardiner shell is not fitted with a percussion
cap at the point of the projectile, and is not easily exploded
by hand, and from the additional fact that only about ten thousand
are reported as having been used in action, I am willing to
believe that the primary purpose of the Government of the United
States in using them was the exploding of caissons. There is,
moreover, no evidence that any of these shells were issued from
the Ordnance Bureau after the year 1863. The Gardiner shells are
so constructed as to have no different appearance in the cartridge
from the common minnie ball&mdash;only the title on the box, and an
examination of the ball when separate from the cartridge, giving
any indication of its explosive character.</p>

<p>I know not <i>certainly</i> if any other such projectiles were used by
the United States troops, nor have I any especial desire to prosecute
the investigation further than to prove the position taken in
this paper.</p>

<p>It would be disingenuous in me if I failed to notice the fact that
a charge somewhat similar to that which begins this article was
made by a correspondent in the <i>Scientific American</i> for September
6th, 1862, volume VII, page 151, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Recently it was my privilege to examine, in the hands of a man
just from Fortress Monroe, an explosive bullet, such as was used
by the Rebels in the six days' battle. It is conical in shape, about
one inch long, made of lead, and consists of two parts&mdash;viz: a
solid head piece and a cylindrical chamber, which are united together
by a screw. From the point of the bullet projects a little
rod, which passes down through a small hole in the head piece
into the chamber below, where it was connected with a percussion
cap. The chamber contains about a tablespoonful of powder.
You can readily perceive that if the bullet should encounter a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
bone or other hard substance when entering a man's body, it will
explode and thereby produce a fatal wound.</p>

<div class="bk1"><p class="rgt">F. J. C.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, August 23, 1862.</p></div></div>

<p>In the Patent Office Report (United States) for 1863-4 will be
found a shell exactly corresponding to this one:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No. 39,593&mdash;Joseph Nottingham Smith, New York, N. Y.&mdash;<i>Improvement
in Elongated Projectile for Firearms</i>&mdash;Patent dated August
18, 1863.</p>

<p>It consists of an elongated cylinder having a charge chamber in
its rear portion, which contains powder for propulsion. The point
is a pointed axical bolt, whose rear is furnished with a percussion
cap, to be exploded by the forward motion of a striker on the concussion
of the projectile.</p></div>

<p>Not having seen this ball, I cannot <i>certainly</i> identify it with the
ball mentioned by F. J. C., but it is evidently the same.</p>

<p>The inference is very natural that if these several projectiles,
patented by the United States Patent Office, as the invention of
Northern men, during the war, and used by the United States
armies, were ever used by the Confederates, it was only as captured
ammunition. It was hardly possible, at any reasonable cost, to
run them through the blockade to the South.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be well to draw attention to Mr. Lossing's
intimation in the note quoted at the beginning of this paper, that
the men of the South were forced into the Confederate ranks
against their will, while those of the North were volunteers. Does
Mr. Lossing purposely forget the United States drafts made to fill
up the depleted regiments in the field, and especially the draft of
May, 1863, two months before the battle of Gettysburg, and the
riots that occurred in New York city as the result of that draft?
Does he purposely forget that the United States established recruiting
offices in Europe to procure men for her armies?</p>

<p>It may be questioned whether as a historian Mr. Lossing is deserving
even the notice of a novice in history; for, while he is
known to be a voluminous writer of American history, he is also
known to be a writer of many and great inaccuracies. A writer
who has allowed himself to be so easily imposed upon as in his
ready acceptance as true history of the Morgan Jones Welsh Indian
fraud (American Historical Record, I, 250); who makes such
glaring historical mistakes as his statement that General Braddock
was defeated and killed at the "battle of the Great Meadows"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
(History of the Revolutionary War), and that Captain John Smith,
the Virginia explorer, had explored the Susquehanna river as far
north as the Wyoming Valley (Harper's Magazine, November,
1860), and who draws so largely on his imagination, and is so
much controlled by his prejudices in his "History of the Civil
War," cannot be considered an entirely trustworthy historian.
But because Mr. Lossing's histories have flooded the North, and
are largely accepted as authentic narrations of events, it is due to
the Confederates and the cause for which they so long and nobly
battled, against such fearful odds, that the truth be made known
and Mr. Lossing's misstatements exposed.</p>

<p>It is earnestly to be hoped that the facts presented in this paper
will forever set at rest the malicious slander so often repeated
against the Confederates, by many who are so willing to believe
anything against them, of having authorized the use in military
warfare of such atrocious and barbarous missiles as "<i>explosive and
poisoned</i>" musket or rifle balls.</p>
